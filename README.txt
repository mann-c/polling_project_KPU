This project was designed to conduct in-person polling for the Richmond North Centre riding during the 2017 BC provincial elections.

The application is used to poll the public, the resulting poll can be broken down by demographic. The results of the poll are saved on the machine and can be added to when the application is launched again.

The application is GUI based and can be compiled using the makefile assuming a java compiler is installed on the machine. The application can be launched using the following command:

java HomeFrame

If any new data was entered into the application since it was last launched it will prompt the user to save the data.
